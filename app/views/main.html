        <p>This application is for preparing CP2K input files. It
            presents the CP2K input sections and their parameters as a tree
            which may be expanded as desired in order to fill in the different
            sections. Once a tree has been prepared a CP2K input file may be
            generated. Existing CP2K input files my be imported for
            further editing.
        </p>
        <p>Inputs may be generated for different versions of CP2K:

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The CP2K Input Editor is designed to aid in the preparation of
            CP2K input files. The sections in the input file and their
            parameters are presented as a tree which may be expanded in
            order to fill in the different sections and subsections.
            Once a valid input tree has been prepared a CP2K input file may be
            generated. Existing CP2K input files my be imported for
            further editing, or one of the pre-existing templates may be
            used as a starting point.
        </p>
        <h3>Selecting a CP2K Version</h3>
        Editors are available for multiple CP2K versions. Click on the home
        page to select the appropriate version for editing.
        <h3>Editing the Input Tree</h3>
        <h4>Section and Parameter Activation</h4>
        <p>
            All sections and parameters in the CP2K input are treated as
            optional. To activate a section or parameter click the activation
            toggle next to its name <i class="enable_button"></i>.
            When a section or subsection is activated
            it will automatically expand. Active section names are shown in
            green and active parameters in blue. To deactivate an section
            or parameter click the <i class="disable_button"></i> toggle icon again.
        </p>
        <p>
            All inactive sections and subsections may be shown or hidden at
            once by clicking the icons in the top right of the tree.
        </p>
        <h4>Tree Expansion</h4>
        <p>
            To expand or close a section of the input tree click on its name. Activation
            of a section automatically expands that section. The tree may be
            completely expanded or closed by using the controls in the top
            right of the tree.
        </p>
        <h4>Editing of Parameters</h4>
        <p>
            Once a parameter has been activated it may be edited. If a parameter
            is defined as a list of options then its value may only be selected from
            this list. Otherwise, free text may be entered into the input box.
            Some validation of the input is performed, for instance to check that
            a value is a number or an integer. If text is invalid then this will
            be shown with a red cross and a help icon will appear with an
            indication of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Help on a parameter may be obtained by hovering over the
            parameter name. The text which appears is the same as that contained
            in the CP2K online manual.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a parameter is not defined then typcially CP2K will use the
            default value for it.
        </p>
        <h4>Repeating a Section or Parameter</h4>
        Some sections or parameters may be specified multiple times in a
        CP2K input file. These are shown with a
        <i class="repeat_button repeat_button_add"></i>
        repeat icon next to their name. Clicking this icon will add a copy
        of that parameter to the tree. Copies may be removed by clicking the
        <i class="repeat_button repeat_button_remove"></i> remove icon.
        <h3>Preparation of CP2K Input File</h3>
        <p>
            When a valid CP2K input tree has been prepared then a file
            suitable for use with CP2K may be created. Click the "Export
            CP2K Input File" button and a dialogue box will be displayed.
            Once the file is created you will be prompted to save it. The
            default name is "cp2k.inp", which may be changed as desired.
            (The behaviour of the download process is browser dependent, some
            browsers may automatically save the file in the Download location
            without further prompting from the user.)
        </p>
        <h3>Import an Existing Input File</h3>
        <p>
            To load an existing CP2K file from your computer click the
            "Load CP2K input file" button. A dialogue will appear which
            will allow you to browse your computer for the file and then
            upload it. Once uploaded the tree will be expanded to show
            those sections which are active in the file.
        </p>
        <h3>Editing a pre-existing template</h3>
        <p>
            Several templates are available which represent common CP2K
            scenarios. These are listed on the left-hand side of the editor
            under "Input Templates". Clicking one of these templates will
            load it into the editor for modification as desired. (Note that
            doing this will overwrite any changes made in the editor.)
